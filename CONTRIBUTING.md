## Contributing to one of my projects

### Suggestions and Bug Reports
If you have either a suggestion or a bug report you can file it on the project's GitHub Repo's Issues page.

### Submitting a Pull Request
If you'd like to add a feature or change part of the code, please:
1) fork the project's repository
2) make a new branch from main with a name that very briefly describes the changes you want to make
3) Test the changes to make sure it doesn't break any existing code and works on the Platforms that the project currently works on 
4) Submit a Pull Request describing the changes you've made and why you've made them (particularly if it's not immediately apparent or obvious)
5) If I haven't commented on the Pull Request or reviewed it within a few weeks of it being created, please feel free to tag me @alastairlundy in the Pull Request.

If you have multiple features or changes you want to add that don't rely on each other, please follow these steps for each change or feature. 

You might find it duplicative or exhausting to do this, and that is understandable, but it helps to ensure that: 
A) individual changes are accepted or declined based on their merits
B) code that is submitted to be merged is reviewed and scrutinized carefully to avoid or mitigate against attacks on Open Source code and infrastructure - We don't need a repeat of the xz utils backdoor attack.
and C) code is safely added to the project without causing the package to suffer as a result of accepting the code. 

If you accept these principles and follows these steps, and your code does make a helpful change, I am likely to agree to merge it.
